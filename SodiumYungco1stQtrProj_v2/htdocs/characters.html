			<h2>ANIMATRONICS</h2>
				<p>Animatronics are machines that power the mascots at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, and the main antagonists of the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise. There are 4 animatronics; Freddy Fazbear, Bonnie, Chica, and Foxy. They must be allowed to walk around at least at night, otherwise they will encounter mobility issues as a result of some sort of malfunction, claimed to be caused by their "servos locking up". Their programming forbids the presence of endoskeletons without outer shells. If they see a human, they may mistake the human for an endoskeleton, and attempt to stuff the body into a suit. This would be fatal, as the animatronic parts in the suit would puncture the body.</p>

			<h2>MIKE SCHMIDT</h2>
			<p>Mike Schmidt is the main protagonist of the first Five Nights at Freddy's game. He was a security guard employed by Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, working on a 7-night shift from midnight to 6 AM, until he was eventually fired after tampering with the animatronics. The game is played in the first-person perspective, through his eyes. Despite the low pay and clear danger, Mike continues his job every night for the rest of the week for unknown reasons. At the end of Night 5, Mike Schmidt receives a check for $120. At the end of Night 6, he receives a comparatively minuscule check of $120.50, an increase of fifty cents. He also receives a note from his boss, stating that he has "earned some overtime!" Upon completing the Custom Night, he receives a notice of termination, likely due to the in-game interaction right before said night, customizing the animatronics A.I. (which the notice describes as tampering with the animatronics).</p>

			<h2>MISSING CHILDREN</h2>
			<p>The Missing Children are referred to throughout the newspapers regarding the incident. The newspapers describe that on multiple days, one of which was June 26, a total of five children were lured into a backroom of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza by a man disguised as one of the franchise's mascots in order to gain their trust. On the morning of June 27, the perpetrator was identified through video surveillance and promptly apprehended by the police. They charged the suspect, but the bodies of the kids were never found and presumed dead. The bodies were hidden inside the animatronics and eventually began to stink up the establishment, blood and mucus beginning to ooze from the character's faces. These happenings heavily damage the reputation of Fazbear Entertainment and play a major role in the declination of the franchise.</p>
